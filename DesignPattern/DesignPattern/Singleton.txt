Singleton Advantages and Guidelines

Advantages
	- Singleton controls concurrent access to the resource.
	- It ensures there is only one object available across the application in a cintrolled state.





Implementation Guidelines
	- Ensure that only one instance of the class exists
	- Provide global access to that instance by 
		- Decalring all the constructors of the class to be private
		- Providing static method that returns a reference to the instance
		- The instance is stored as a private static variable.
